### Hi👋🏽

I am a ***Web Developer*** and ***Designer*** with a real passion for creating interfaces and applications that are highly intuitive and engaging. I spend my time diving into new technologies, building out projects and researching what makes the most natural UX. Mainly focused on Front-End and the visual aspects of web applications but always willing to dip into the Back-End and try my luck working with API’s and Databases.

### My Technologies:
- 🎨Languages: Python, Javascript (TS), Java
- 📱Front-End: Vue (Vuex), Svelte, tailwind
- ⚙️Back-End: Flask, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- 🕹Other: Git, Jira
